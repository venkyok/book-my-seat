## 🔍 Technical Details

### Demo Detection Logic:
```python
IS_DEMO_MODE = os.environ.get('VERCEL', False) or not os.access(settings.BASE_DIR, os.W_OK)
```

**Checks:**
1. `VERCEL` environment variable (set by Vercel)
2. Filesystem write permissions (Vercel = read-only)

### Data Flow:
```
Local Mode:           Demo Mode:
Movie.objects.all()   demo_data.get_demo_movies()
Theater.objects...    demo_data.get_demo_theaters()
Seat.objects...       demo_data.get_demo_seats()
Database writes ✅    Database writes ❌ (friendly message)
```

### Mock Objects:
```python
class DemoMovie:
    - Has all Movie model attributes
    - No database queries
    - Instant response

class DemoTheater:
    - Has all Theater model attributes  
    - Linked to DemoMovie
    - Calculates available_seats dynamically

class DemoSeat:
    - Generated on-the-fly
    - Realistic seat layouts (rows A-H)
    - Mixed booked/available status
```

## 🎯 Expected Vercel Behavior

### ✅ What Works:
- Homepage loads with 8 movies
- All movie posters display
- Filters work (genre, language)
- Search works
- Theater pages load
- Beautiful responsive design
- All static files (CSS/JS)

### ⚠️ What Shows Messages:

- Login button → Info message
- Book Seats button → Helpful explanation

### ❌ What Doesn't Happen:
- No database errors
- No 500 errors
- No "attempt to write a readonly database"

---

## 🐛 Error Resolution

### Before (Your Error):
```
OperationalError at /register/
attempt to write a readonly database
```

### After (Now):
```
✅ Demo Mode: Registration is disabled on Vercel (read-only database). 
   This is a visual demonstration...
```

**The error is completely prevented** by detecting demo mode BEFORE attempting database writes!
