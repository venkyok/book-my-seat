## Access

### URL
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/movies/admin-dashboard/
```

### Requirements
- Must be logged in as staff member (`is_staff=True`)
- Quick access button on Django admin index page
- Direct link from admin header

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (admin_views.py)

```python
@staff_member_required
def admin_dashboard(request):
    # Complex aggregation queries using Django ORM
    # Efficient database queries with annotations
    # Time-based filtering
    # JSON serialization for charts
```

**Key Features:**
- Uses `@staff_member_required` decorator for security
- Efficient Django ORM queries with `annotate()`, `aggregate()`
- Timezone-aware datetime handling
- Optimized database queries (minimal N+1 problems)

### Database Queries

**Revenue Calculation:**
```python
total_revenue = Booking.objects.filter(
    payment_status='paid'
).aggregate(total=Sum('amount'))['total'] or 0
```

**Popular Movies:**
```python
popular_movies = Booking.objects.filter(
    payment_status='paid'
).values('movie__name', 'movie__id', 'movie__genre', 'movie__language')
.annotate(total_bookings=Count('id'), revenue=Sum('amount'))
.order_by('-total_bookings')[:10]
```

**Revenue Trend (Last 7 Days):**
```python
for i in range(6, -1, -1):
    day = timezone.now() - timedelta(days=i)
    # Calculate day revenue and bookings
    # Build chart data array
```

### Frontend (dashboard.html)

**Technologies:**
- Bootstrap 5.1.3 for responsive layout
- Font Awesome 6.0 for icons
- Chart.js 3.7.0 for interactive charts
- Custom CSS with gradient designs

**Design Features:**
- Responsive grid layout
- Hover effects on stat cards
- Gradient color schemes
- Clean, modern UI
- Mobile-friendly tables

**Chart Implementations:**
1. Line Chart (Revenue Trend)
   - Dual Y-axis (revenue + bookings)
   - Smooth curves (tension: 0.4)
   - Filled areas with transparency

2. Doughnut Chart (Payment Methods)
   - Color-coded segments
   - Percentage labels
   - Legend at bottom

## Data Visualization

### Stat Cards
- **Revenue Card**: Purple gradient, rupee icon
- **Bookings Card**: Pink gradient, ticket icon
- **Users Card**: Blue gradient, users icon
- **Occupancy Card**: Green gradient, chair icon

### Color Coding
- Paid: Green (`bg-success`)
- Pending: Yellow (`bg-warning`)
- Failed: Red (`bg-danger`)
- Refunded: Gray (`bg-secondary`)

### Icons
- 🏆 Trophy: #1 customer
- 🥈 Silver Medal: #2 customer
- 🥉 Bronze Medal: #3 customer

## Performance Optimization

1. **Efficient Queries**
   - Single queries with aggregation
   - Minimal database hits
   - Use of `values()` for projection

2. **Caching Opportunities** (future)
   - Cache dashboard data for 5 minutes
   - Invalidate on new booking

3. **Lazy Loading**
   - Tables paginated (future enhancement)
   - Load charts after data ready

## Security

### Access Control
```python
@staff_member_required
```
- Requires `request.user.is_staff == True`
- Redirects non-staff to login

### SQL Injection Prevention
- Uses Django ORM (parameterized queries)
- No raw SQL

### XSS Prevention
- Django template escaping enabled
- `|safe` only on JSON data

## Usage Examples

### 1. Monitor Daily Revenue
```
View dashboard → Check Revenue Trend chart
See today's revenue vs. yesterday
```

### 2. Identify Best Performing Movies
```
Scroll to Popular Movies table
Sort by revenue or bookings
Plan marketing campaigns
```

### 3. Track Customer Loyalty
```
View Top Customers table
Identify VIP customers (>₹1000)
Send targeted promotions
```

### 4. Optimize Theater Allocation
```
Check Busiest Theaters table
See occupancy rates
Allocate more shows to busy theaters
```

### 5. Analyze Payment Methods
```
View Payment Method pie chart
Identify preferred methods
Optimize payment gateway fees
```

## Customization

### Change Time Periods
Edit `admin_views.py`:
```python
days = int(request.GET.get('days', 30))  # Change default
```

### Add More Filters
Add genre/language filters:
```python
genre = request.GET.get('genre')
if genre:
    # Filter queries by genre
```

### Customize Charts
Edit `dashboard.html`:
```javascript
// Change colors
backgroundColor: ['#667eea', '#f5576c', ...]

// Change chart type
type: 'bar'  // Instead of 'line'
```

### Add New Metrics
In `admin_views.py`:
```python
# Example: Average booking value per user
avg_booking_per_user = total_revenue / active_users
context['avg_booking_per_user'] = avg_booking_per_user
```

## Testing

### Test Data Generation
```python
# Run Django shell
python manage.py shell

# Create test bookings
from movies.models import Booking
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
# ... create bookings
```

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Dashboard shows no data
**Solution**: Create some paid bookings first using the payment system

**Issue**: Charts not rendering
**Solution**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors, ensure Chart.js CDN is accessible

**Issue**: 403 Forbidden error
**Solution**: User must be staff member. Run:
```python
python manage.py shell
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
user = User.objects.get(username='your_username')
user.is_staff = True
user.save()
```

**Issue**: Revenue calculation incorrect
**Solution**: Check payment_status filter - only 'paid' bookings should count

**Issue**: Slow dashboard loading
**Solution**: 
- Check database query count
- Add database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Implement caching

## Database Indexes (Recommended)

Add to `models.py`:
```python
class Booking(models.Model):
    # ... fields ...
    
    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-booked_at']
        indexes = [
            models.Index(fields=['payment_status', 'payment_date']),
            models.Index(fields=['user', 'payment_status']),
            models.Index(fields=['movie', 'payment_status']),
            models.Index(fields=['theater', 'payment_status']),
        ]
```

## API Endpoints (Future)

Create REST API for dashboard data:
```python
# api/views.py
@api_view(['GET'])
def dashboard_api(request):
    # Return JSON data for external consumption
    # Useful for mobile apps, third-party integrations
```

## Production Deployment

### Performance
- Enable database connection pooling
- Use PostgreSQL for better aggregation performance
- Implement Redis caching
- Use CDN for Chart.js and Bootstrap

### Security
- HTTPS only
- CSRF protection enabled
- Rate limiting on dashboard endpoint
- Audit logging for admin access

### Monitoring
- Track dashboard load times
- Alert on slow queries (>1s)
- Monitor API rate limits
- Log all admin actions
