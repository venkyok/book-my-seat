# Email Confirmation Feature - Implementation Guide

## Overview
Implemented automatic email confirmation for ticket bookings. Users receive a beautifully formatted email with complete booking details after successfully booking seats.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Email Utility Module** (`movies/email_utils.py`)
Created a reusable email sending function that:
- Sends HTML and plain text emails
- Includes all booking details (movie, theater, seats, time)
- Handles errors gracefully
- Checks if user has email address before sending

### 2. **Email Templates**
Created two email templates:

#### HTML Template (`templates/emails/booking_confirmation.html`)
- Professional design with modern styling
- Color-coded sections for better readability
- Responsive layout that works on all devices
- Includes:
  - Movie details (name, genre, language, rating)
  - Theater and show information
  - Seat numbers displayed as badges
  - Booking timestamp
  - Important instructions for users

#### Text Template (`templates/emails/booking_confirmation.txt`)
- Plain text fallback for email clients that don't support HTML
- Contains all the same information in a readable format

### 3. **Updated Booking View** (`movies/views.py`)
Enhanced the `book_seats` function to:
- Track successful bookings separately
- Send confirmation email after successful booking
- Display success/info messages to users
- Handle partial booking scenarios (some seats already booked)
- Inform users if email address is missing

### 4. **Email Configuration** (`bookmyseat/settings.py`)
Updated settings with:
- Console backend for development (emails print to terminal)
- Configuration template for production email services
- Comments explaining how to set up Gmail, SendGrid, etc.

## How It Works

### User Flow:
1. User selects seats and completes booking
2. System creates booking records in database
3. System automatically sends confirmation email
4. User sees success message with email confirmation status
5. User receives email with complete booking details

### Email Content Includes:
- ✓ User's name
- ✓ Movie name, genre, language, rating
- ✓ Theater name
- ✓ Show date and time
- ✓ All booked seat numbers
- ✓ Booking timestamp
- ✓ Important instructions

## Development Testing

### Current Setup (Development):
Emails are configured to print to the **console/terminal** instead of actually sending.

### To Test:
1. Ensure the server is running
2. Make a booking through the application
3. Check the terminal/console output
4. You'll see the complete email content printed there

Example console output:
```
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
Subject: Booking Confirmation - Movie Name
From: noreply@bookmyseat.com
To: user@example.com
Date: ...

[Email content will be displayed here]
```

## Production Configuration

### For Gmail (Example):
1. Create an App Password for your Gmail account:
   - Go to Google Account Settings
   - Security → 2-Step Verification → App Passwords
   - Generate a new app password

2. Update `settings.py`:
```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-app-specific-password'
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'BookMySeat <noreply@bookmyseat.com>'
```

### For SendGrid (Alternative):
```python
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.sendgrid.net'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'apikey'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-sendgrid-api-key'
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'BookMySeat <noreply@bookmyseat.com>'
```

### For Other Services:
- Amazon SES
- Mailgun
- Postmark
- Any SMTP-compatible service

## User Messages

The application now shows Django messages to inform users:

### Success Messages:
- "Booking successful! Confirmation email sent to user@example.com"
- "Booking successful!" (if email sending fails)

### Info Messages:
- "Please add your email to receive booking confirmations." (if user has no email)

### Warning Messages:
- Displays if some seats were already booked but partial booking succeeded

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. `movies/email_utils.py` - Email sending utility
2. `templates/emails/booking_confirmation.html` - HTML email template
3. `templates/emails/booking_confirmation.txt` - Plain text email template
4. `EMAIL_CONFIRMATION_GUIDE.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:
1. `movies/views.py` - Updated book_seats function
2. `bookmyseat/settings.py` - Enhanced email configuration

## Testing Checklist

### Development Testing:
- [x] Email configuration added
- [ ] Make a test booking
- [ ] Check terminal for email output
- [ ] Verify all booking details appear correctly
- [ ] Test with user without email address
- [ ] Test with multiple seats

### Production Testing (Before Deployment):
- [ ] Configure production email service
- [ ] Update EMAIL_BACKEND settings
- [ ] Add email credentials (use environment variables!)
- [ ] Test sending real emails
- [ ] Verify HTML renders correctly in email clients
- [ ] Test on mobile email apps
- [ ] Check spam folder settings

## Security Best Practices

### Important Notes:
1. **Never commit email passwords to git**
   - Use environment variables
   - Use `.env` files (add to .gitignore)
   
2. **For production, use environment variables:**
```python
import os
EMAIL_HOST_USER = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_USER')
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = os.environ.get('EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD')
```

3. **Use app-specific passwords** for Gmail, not your main password

4. **Consider using dedicated email services** (SendGrid, Mailgun) for better deliverability

## Troubleshooting

### Email not appearing in console:
- Check that EMAIL_BACKEND is set to console backend
- Ensure server is running in terminal (not background)
- Look for the email output after making a booking

### Email not sending in production:
- Verify SMTP credentials are correct
- Check firewall/port settings (587, 465, or 25)
- Ensure EMAIL_USE_TLS or EMAIL_USE_SSL is set correctly
- Check spam folder
- Review email service logs

### User not receiving emails:
- Verify user has email address in their profile
- Check email service sending limits
- Verify sender domain reputation
- Check if emails are being marked as spam
