# Genre and Language Filters - Implementation Guide

## Overview
Successfully implemented genre and language filters for the Django movie booking application.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Movie Model** (`movies/models.py`)
Added two new fields to the Movie model:
- **genre**: CharField with predefined choices (Action, Comedy, Drama, Horror, Thriller, Romance, Sci-Fi, Adventure, Animation, Crime)
- **language**: CharField with predefined choices (Hindi, English, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Bengali, Marathi)

Both fields have default values to ensure backward compatibility with existing data.

### 2. **Views** (`movies/views.py`)
Updated the `movie_list` view to:
- Accept genre and language filter parameters from GET requests
- Apply filters to the movie queryset
- Pass genre and language choices to the template for dropdown rendering
- Maintain the existing search functionality

Also fixed pre-existing bugs in the `book_seats` function:
- Fixed undefined `theater` variable (changed to `theaters`)
- Fixed the `join` syntax error (changed from `',',join()` to `','.join()`)

### 3. **Template** (`templates/movies/movie_list.html`)
Enhanced the UI with:
- Genre dropdown filter with auto-submit on change
- Language dropdown filter with auto-submit on change
- "Clear Filters" button that appears when filters are active
- Display of genre and language badges on each movie card
- Improved layout using Bootstrap grid system

### 4. **Admin Interface** (`movies/admin.py`)
Updated the MovieAdmin class to:
- Display genre and language in the list view
- Add filter options in the admin sidebar
- Include search functionality for name, cast, and description

## How to Use

### For Administrators:
1. Log into the Django admin panel
2. Go to Movies section
3. When adding or editing movies, select appropriate genre and language from dropdowns
4. Use the sidebar filters to quickly find movies by genre or language

### For Users:
1. Visit the movie list page
2. Use the dropdown filters to:
   - Filter by genre (e.g., Action, Comedy)
   - Filter by language (e.g., Hindi, English)
3. Combine filters with the search bar for precise results
4. Click "Clear Filters" to reset all filters
5. Each movie card now displays genre and language badges for easy identification
