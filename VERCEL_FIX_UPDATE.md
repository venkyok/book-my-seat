# üîß Vercel Configuration Updated - Action Required

## ‚úÖ What Was Fixed

I've updated the Vercel configuration to fix the deployment issues:

### Changes Made:

1. **Created `index.py`** - Proper WSGI handler for Vercel
   - Vercel expects an `app` or `application` variable
   - Properly sets up Django WSGI

2. **Updated `vercel.json`**
   - Now uses `index.py` instead of `bookmyseat/wsgi.py`
   - Removed the static-build configuration that was causing warnings
   - Added `PYTHON_VERSION` environment variable

3. **Created `vercel_build.sh`** - Optional build script

---

## üöÄ Next Steps in Vercel Dashboard

Your deployment should automatically trigger from the git push. Here's what to check:

### 1. Check Build Progress

Go to your Vercel dashboard and watch the deployment.

### 2. If Build Succeeds

‚úÖ Your app should be live!

Visit: `https://your-app-name.vercel.app`

### 3. If Build Fails

Check the error and follow the fixes below.

## üîß Additional Configuration in Vercel Dashboard

Even though the build completes, you need to ensure these settings:

### In Project Settings ‚Üí General:

1. **Build & Development Settings:**
   - Leave as default (the warning is okay - we're using `vercel.json`)

2. **Root Directory:** 
   - Leave as `./` (root)

### In Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables:

Make sure these are all set:

| Variable | Value | Required |
|----------|-------|----------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Generate new | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `DEBUG` | `False` | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Your Neon URL | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `ALLOWED_HOSTS` | `.vercel.app` | ‚úÖ Yes |
| `PYTHON_VERSION` | `3.11` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Helps |
| `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` | Your key | Optional |
| `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` | Your secret | Optional |

## üîç Verify the Deployment

### Check 1: Homepage
Visit: `https://your-app.vercel.app/`

Should show the movie list page.

### Check 2: Admin Panel
Visit: `https://your-app.vercel.app/admin/`

Should show Django admin login.

### Check 3: Static Files
Check if CSS is loading properly.

If not, static files might not be collected.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: "Application Error"

**Cause:** Missing environment variables or database connection failed

**Fix:**
1. Check all environment variables are set in Vercel
2. Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct (from Neon dashboard)
3. Ensure database has `?sslmode=require` at the end

### Issue: "Module not found"

**Cause:** Missing dependency

**Fix:**
1. Check if all dependencies are in `requirements.txt`
2. Redeploy to trigger fresh install

### Issue: Static files (CSS) not loading

**Cause:** Static files not collected properly

**Fix:**
1. Check build logs for "Collecting static files"
2. Ensure `STATIC_ROOT` is set in settings.py
3. WhiteNoise should handle this automatically

### Issue: Still using Python 3.12

**Cause:** Vercel's new build system uses latest by default

**Solution:**
This is actually okay! Python 3.12 is compatible with Django 5.1.
The important thing is that your app works.

## üìã Post-Deployment Checklist

After successful deployment:

- [ ] Homepage loads without errors
- [ ] Admin panel accessible
- [ ] Static files (CSS) loading
- [ ] Run migrations on production database
- [ ] Create superuser
- [ ] Add sample movies/theaters
- [ ] Test booking flow
- [ ] Configure media storage (Cloudinary)
- [ ] Setup cron job for seat cleanup

---

## üéØ Run Migrations

**Important:** You still need to run migrations manually!

### Method 1: Using Vercel CLI

```powershell
# Install Vercel CLI (if not already)
npm install -g vercel

# Login
vercel login

# Link to your project
cd "c:\Users\vy916\Desktop\django\djnago-bookmyshow-clone"
vercel link

# Pull environment variables
vercel env pull .env.production

# Run migrations
$env:DATABASE_URL = "your-neon-database-url-here"
python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Method 2: Direct Database Connection

Use pgAdmin or DBeaver to connect to your Neon database and run migrations.

## üîÑ Automatic Redeployment

Vercel should now automatically redeploy when you push to GitHub.

The changes have been pushed, so:
1. Check your Vercel dashboard
2. A new deployment should be in progress
3. Wait for it to complete
4. Test your app!

---

## üìä Expected Build Output

Your build logs should now show:

```
‚úì Installing dependencies from requirements.txt
‚úì Building...
‚úì Collecting static files
‚úì Build completed
‚úì Deployment ready
```

---

## üÜò Still Not Working?

### Option 1: Check the Logs

1. Go to Vercel dashboard
2. Click your project
3. Click "Deployments"
4. Click the latest deployment
5. Check "Build Logs" and "Function Logs"

### Option 2: Try Manual Deployment

```powershell
cd "c:\Users\vy916\Desktop\django\djnago-bookmyshow-clone"
vercel --prod
```

### Option 3: Switch to Render

If Vercel continues to be problematic, Render.com is much easier for Django:

See: **`RENDER_URGENT_FIX.md`**

Render provides:
- Built-in PostgreSQL (no Neon needed)
- Easier configuration
- Better Django support
